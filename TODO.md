- [x] Consider creating multiple materialized views for leaderboard queries:
    - Top N per group (current)
    - Top N globally (per season, regardless of group)
    - Top N per period, per dungeon, etc.
  This would optimize performance and ensure correct results for each use case. (Parked for now)
